# Wine-Quality-Regression-in-Python
Data for wine quality based on a number of different factors downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data

I used Python to perform multiple linear regression and backward elimination to discover that the wine quality is most affected by volatile acidity, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, pH, and alcohol content.
